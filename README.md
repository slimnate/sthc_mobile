# sthc_mobile

A mobile app built with Flutter that is designed to monitor and control my Snake Tank Humidity Controller project.

## Getting Started

This project connects to an arduino on the local network running the code in [this repo](https://github.com/slimnate/arduino_climate_control), and is designed to connect with it and provide the following functionality via a web server running on the arduino:
- View the server time, humidity status, and light status
- Update humidity controller settings 
- Update light schedule

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)

[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
